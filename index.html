				<h3>Foreword</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Space Station 13</b> has been around for almost 15 years.<br>
				BYOND is terrible and might as well be stuck in the 2000's.<br>
				It's been obvious for a long time that we need a remake.
				</p>

				<p>
				The original remake died.<br>
				Then SS14 lived for a month and effectively died.<br>
				What was once a bustling 100 people IRC channel on Rizon was reduced to 15 people whose
				join and leave messages are the only thing filling space (bus).<br>
				There have been absolutely uncountable attempts. All have failed one way or another.
				</p>

				<p>
				But giving up isn't the solution.<br>
				<i>We're gonna get this game off BYOND. And fix it at the same time.</i>
				</p>

				<p>
				We're gonna fix the clunky controls.
				The laggy UI.
				The lack of a proper Linux client.
				The terrible development experience.
				</p>

				<p>
				<b>Space Station 14 is alive and kicking again.</b><br>
				Let's finish this.
				</p>

				<h3>The plan</h3>
				<p>
				Well, obviously, a remake. Free from the shackles of BYOND. But not just that.<br>
				</p>

				<p>
				Current SS13 is clunky and annoying to play.
				This is heavily due to BYOND. Not only do we want to get <i>us</i> off BYOND, we also want to get the <i>game</i> off of it.<br>
				No more clunky movement. Pixel perfect combat. Probably a rotating station. A station more scary and dark than Dead Space? Sure!
				</p>

				<p>
				We can't do this alone though. Neither Rome nor SS13 was built in a day. Did you know SS13 has ~400,000 lines of code?
				</p>

				<h3>The Road Ahead</h3>

				The current tasks at hand are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Sieve through oldcode and remove and fix stuff.</li>
					<li>Rework the rendering engine to be properly cross platform.</li>
					<li>Implement a proper scripting system and get rolling on content.</li>
				</ul>

				Right now, we consider the code in a "pre-alpha" state.
				When we finish these tasks, we will move into "alpha" and start following rules such as properly versioning the game.<br>
				<br>
				<b>When we hit alpha we will also rework this website to have monthly development updates.</b>
